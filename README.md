### HTML Files

- **index.html:**
   - This file will serve as the main page of the application. It will contain the necessary HTML elements to display an input field for the user to input the data to be audited.
   - It will also include a button that triggers the JavaScript function to submit the data to the Flask server for processing.

### Routes

- **`/submit_data`**:
   - This route will be responsible for handling the data submitted by the user. It will receive the data as a POST request and save it to a database or perform any necessary processing.
   - After processing the data, the route should redirect the user to a confirmation page or provide a response indicating the successful submission of the data.
